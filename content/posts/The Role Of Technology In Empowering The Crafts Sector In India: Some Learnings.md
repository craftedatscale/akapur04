I recently moderated a session titled "From Low-Tech to AI: Building Tech-Led Efficiencies in Craft-Value Chains" at the [Kula Conclave 2024](https://www.kulaconclave.com/kula-2024-highlights). The discussion explored the diverse opportunities that arise from tech adoption in the craft sector, while also challenging conventional ideas of what “tech” entails.<br /> 
<br />

## Technology is multi-faceted, artisan needs too
Conversations with MeMeraki, The Center for Pastoralism, SASHA and Rug Republic highlighted the multifaceted nature of technology—spanning digital, environmental, materials, design, and low-tech solutions. We examined applications such as traceability, authentication, concept iteration, sustainability, and human-centered design to empower artisan entrepreneurs.<br /> 

A key takeaway was how several stakeholders in India’s handmade sector seamlessly integrate diverse technologies. Artisan #entrepreneurs not only use #AI to bounce ideas and create service design solutions but also leverage it to champion and support heritage crafts. This fusion of tradition and innovation is both inspiring and timely.<br /> 
<br />

## Benchmarking, conscientious investment and beyond
What we need now is greater benchmarking and conscientious investment to scale these solutions. While one-size-fits-all approaches won’t work, the innovations emerging from this sector hold immense potential to drive sustainable and inclusive growth. Investors, one hopes you're listening!<br />
