Proud to have won The Reality Virtually Hackathon, hosted by the MIT Media Lab, leading my team #ARound.

I was awarded the Leader Award for leading a diverse team with integrity and initiative from over 400 hackers. We won the AR and VR for Good and Education Award for their AR navigational app for the visually impaired and are selected 2nd best in the Mobile Hack category. <br />
