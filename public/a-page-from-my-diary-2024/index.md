# A Page from My Diary: 2024

I arrived in the U.S. on the eve of the elections — a moment charged with anticipation and reflection on the state of democracy. Against this backdrop I had the honor of seeing five of my portraits unveiled at the [Harvard Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation](https://ash.harvard.edu/), celebrating leaders who have shaped and upheld democratic values.<br />
<br />
## The opening
Colleagues and friends joined me for a tour of the space, where we reflected on the opportunities and responsibilities of keeping democracy alive. Creating these pieces was a deeply reflective journey. Through stitches, textures, and up-cycled materials, I sought to honor the resilience and light of these leaders, while paying tribute to the layers of history and culture that shape our understanding of leadership.

This process allowed me to blend my love for collaboration, the tactile joy of creation, and craft practices passed down through family and friendships.<br />

## Remembering Gandhi and Dandi
One of the pieces closest to my heart is the portrait of Gandhi, depicting the Dandi March. For this work, I used salt in the aquarelle base to add both texture and symbolism. The march, a cornerstone of India's history, deeply moves me. As American journalist Webb Miller wrote of the collective commitment to non-violent resistance at Dharsana: “Suddenly... at a word of command, scores of native police rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads… Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins.”

Walking through the space, surrounded by these stories of courage and hope, I was reminded of the importance of community and dialogue in fostering democracy. My hope is that these pieces spark reflection and action, encouraging conversations about the role we all play in sustaining democracy — whether as artists, policymakers, or everyday citizens.<br />

## Thank you, Ash Center!
Grateful for this opportunity, the support of the Ash Center, and the chance to reflect on this journey with those who joined me.

As we look ahead to 2025, I hope to continue to be part of shaping the conversations we need for a more hopeful future.<br />
