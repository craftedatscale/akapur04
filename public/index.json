A key takeaway was how several stakeholders in India’s handmade sector seamlessly integrate diverse technologies. Artisan #entrepreneurs not only use #AI to bounce ideas and create service design solutions but also leverage it to champion and support heritage crafts.

For this work, I used salt in the aquarelle base to add both texture and symbolism. The march, a cornerstone of India’s history, deeply moves me. As American journalist Webb Miller wrote of the collective commitment to non-violent resistance at Dharsana: “Suddenly… at a word of command, scores of native police rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads… Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins.” Walking through the space, surrounded by these stories of courage and hope, I was reminded of the importance of community and dialogue in fostering democracy. My hope is that these pieces spark reflection and action, encouraging conversations about the role we all play in sustaining democracy — whether as artists, policymakers, or everyday citizens.
